# To increase readability and make it more customizable, changes are going to be split into different files.
# As an id, consecutive integers are used.
# Each main version X has its own folder named changeLog-X.x (the x here is not to be substituted!!!).
# Inside are the changesets.

# For each major version, one change log is created which imports all change logs for this version. This helps to keep the root change log smaller.
# File name looks like changeLog-X.x.yaml - where X is the major version and x is a placeholder (not to be substituted).
# Each changeset has its own file named changeLog-X.Y_Z_i, where X is the version of the current
# folder, Y is the minor version and Z the fix version the change belongs to. i is the running index of the changes for the same release.
# For example "changeLog-3.0.0_1.yaml". If two changes occur in the same minor version, use "changeLog-3.0.0_2.yaml" to distinguish between them.
# Please stick to these naming guidelines, to avoid conflicts.
#
# When creating a change log, adding a the rollback attribute helps to easier test and rollback database changes.
# The rollback attribute should be provided wherever possible!
#
# To include a new changeset, generate a new version folder (if not already there) and then create your changeset - follow
# the naming guidelines. Then append an include statement below, including your new changeset.
# Important - keep in mind the id - check which one your predecessor used.
