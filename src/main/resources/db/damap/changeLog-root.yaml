# To increase readability and make it more customizable, changes are going to be split into different files.
# As an id, consecutive integers are used.
# Each main version Y has its own folder named changeLog-Y.x (the x here is not to be substituted!!!).
# Inside are the changesets. Each changeset has its own file named changeLog-Y.x_1, where Y is the version of the current
# folder and x is the minor version the change belongs to. For example "changeLog-3.0.0_1.yaml". If two changes occur in the same
# minor version, use "changeLog-3.0.0_2.yaml" to distinguish between them.
# Please stick to these naming guidelines, to avoid conflicts.
#
# To include a new changeset, generate a new version folder (if not already there) and then create your changeset - follow
# the naming guidelines. Then append an include statement below, including your new changeset.
# Important - keep in mind the id - check which one your predecessor used.
#
# The commented out include statement below includes a sample changeset, to show how it should be done. If you are
# the first one to add a changeset using the new system - uncomment it and adapt it to your needs.
# Afterward please delete this comment-block.
